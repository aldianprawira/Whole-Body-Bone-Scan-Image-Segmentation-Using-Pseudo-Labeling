## U-Net++
UNet++ is an architecture for semantic segmentation based on the U-Net. Through the use of densely connected nested decoder sub-networks, it enhances extracted feature processing and was reported by its authors to outperform the U-Net in Electron Microscopy (EM), Cell, Nuclei, Brain Tumor, Liver and Lung Nodule medical image segmentation tasks.

## Key Features
- **Nested Dense Skip Pathways**: Redesigned skip connections reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder feature maps, enabling the optimizer to learn more efficiently.
- **Deep Supervision**: Multi-level supervision during training improves convergence and segmentation accuracy.
